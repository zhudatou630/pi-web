 * Estimate active wall-clock time from the append-only session log.

 * Raw entries preserve compacted history and every executed branch exactly
 * once. Gaps ending at user messages are treated as human idle. User-initiated
 * bash entries are also boundaries because the log records only their finish
 * time, so counting the incoming gap could include arbitrary human idle.
 * System-prompt snapshots are skipped: they are written at prompt time just
 * before the user message, so counting them would bill the preceding idle.
